 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

 Overview
This repository contains the work I completed for my first task at CodeTech IT Solutions in the Data Science domain. The task focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights. The findings from this analysis are crucial for driving data-driven decisions in our projects.

 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Utilize various visualization tools to illustrate data trends and distributions.
- Identify key variables and relationships within the data.
- Generate comprehensive reports providing actionable insights for stakeholders.

 Key Highlights
- Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Visualization: Employed a range of visual tools, including histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices, to represent data patterns effectively.
- Insights: Identified significant trends, correlations, and anomalies in the data, leading to valuable recommendations for project decisions.
- Reporting: Created detailed reports summarizing the findings and suggesting potential next steps for further analysis and model building.

 Tools and Technologies Used
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization
- Git: For version control and collaboration

 Results
The EDA provided a deep understanding of the dataset, highlighted important patterns, and offered a solid foundation for subsequent data modeling and machine learning tasks. The insights gained from this analysis will guide our data-driven strategy and decision-making process.

 Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks documenting the EDA process
- `reports/`: Generated reports summarizing findings and insights
